# CSC212
Simply put, this is my homework.  Currently in CSC212: Intermediate Object Oriented Programming at Trident University International.

If you stumble accross this repo because you are in the same or similar course, I hope it helps you, but I make no promises that the code os pretty or correct (although it generally runs without errors)
